# Neural-Network-For-Harvard-Spectral-Star-Classification
 This project employs an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify 600,000+ stars from Gaia DR3 into seven types (O, B, A, F, G, K, M) with 84% accuracy, leveraging features like Gmag, BPmag, RPmag, and Lum-Flame. Techniques like SMOTE and MinMax scaling improved performance, showcasing deep learning's potential in astronomy.
